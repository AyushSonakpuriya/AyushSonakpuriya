# 👋 Hey, I'm Ayush Sonakpuriya

I'm an **engineering student** who loves turning ideas into functional, aesthetic web experiences.  
I like systems that make sense, interfaces that feel right, and code that doesn’t scream for help.

💡 Still learning the ropes of modern development, but I enjoy every bug, crash, and “why isn’t this working” moment.  
Because that’s where the fun (and caffeine dependency) begins.

### 🌱 What I’m Into
- Building **modern, responsive web apps**  
- Learning **frontend frameworks** and exploring backend basics  
- Getting into **UI/UX design** that looks clean without overcomplicating things  
- Collaborating on projects that push me out of my comfort zone  

---

### 🧰 Tech & Tools
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS (currently exploring React)  
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js (beginner level, but learning fast)  
- **Other Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman  

> not a senior dev yet, but my Ctrl+Z skills are elite.

### 🎬 When I'm Not Coding
If I’m not buried in code, you’ll probably find me:
- Watching **Hollywood films**—from Nolan’s mind-benders to Fincher’s slow burns  
- Sketching random ideas that might become my next project  
- Daydreaming about building something people actually use

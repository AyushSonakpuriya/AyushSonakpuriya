## 🎥 About Me

I'm **Ayush Sonakpuriya**, an engineering student who believes creativity isn’t a side skill — it’s the core of everything worth building.  
I see **code** as a form of storytelling — structure, emotion, rhythm — just like cinema, but in logic and pixels.  

> “Some people write scripts, others write code. I just try to make both look good.”

## 🎬 Beyond Code

🎞️ Deeply inspired by **Christopher Nolan’s storytelling** — layered, thoughtful, cinematic.  
🎧 Passionate about **music, soundtracks, and minimalist design.**  
🖋️ Occasionally sketch, design, or dream up visuals that feel *aesthetic yet functional.*  
📷 I find beauty in detail — the shadows, the silence, the transitions.

> “Art and logic are never opposites — they’re just written in different languages.”

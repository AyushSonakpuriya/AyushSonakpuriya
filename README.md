## 🎥 About Me 

I'm **Ayush Sonakpuriya**, an engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into things that actually *work and look good*.  
For me, creativity isn’t about big words — it’s about making design and logic blend naturally.  
I like clean interfaces, smooth experiences, and code that feels effortless when it runs.

> "I don’t chase perfection, just balance — where design feels human and code feels alive."

## 🎬 Beyond Code

🎞️ Deeply inspired by **Christopher Nolan’s storytelling** — layered, thoughtful, cinematic.  
🎧 Passionate about **music, soundtracks, and minimalist design.**  
🖋️ Occasionally sketch, design, or dream up visuals that feel *aesthetic yet functional.*  
📷 I find beauty in detail — the shadows, the silence, the transitions.
